# üêö Abalone Age Prediction

This project aims to predict the **age of abalone** large, slow-growing marine snails using physical measurements and weights, based on a dataset of ~4,000 harvested specimens. The goal is to find a **non-invasive** method of estimating age, without needing to dissect the animal.

##  Abalone Properties Context

**Abalone** are large, <span style="color:rgb(37, 150, 190);"> slow-growing marine snails </span>. In many parts of the world, they are an **economically significant fishery**, both as **commercial operations** and a **traditionally-important food source** for many cultures.

Abalone are **harvested from the wild** rather than farmed, and **sustainability** of a **slow-growing resource** is an important issue. A key issue is determining the **age** of a specimen. The rigorous approach is to **harvest and dissect** the specimen to **count growth rings** in the flesh. Obviously, a reliable **non-fatal means** of estimating specimen **age** is highly desirable.

This dataset, provided as **`abalone_growth.csv`**, collects measurements on around **4000 harvested specimens**, and can be used to **identify reliable predictors of sample age**.

| `Shell weight`    | After being dried (in grams)                                                |
| `Rings`           | Number of growth rings ‚Üí **Age = Rings + 1.5** (approximate in years)       |
